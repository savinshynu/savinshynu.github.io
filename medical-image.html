            <p style="text-align:justify;"> The project involves classification of medical images collected from X-ray, MRI and CT scans into five categories—Hand, Breast, Head, Abdomen, and
                 Chest—using two deep learning models: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>All the images were normalized and the dataset was shuffled and split into training, validation, and test sets with 80:10:10 ratio.
                Let's take a look at different categories of images in the dataset.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align:left;">Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</h3> 
                <p>A simplified CNN model was implemented, which generally provides better results for image data due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. 
                    Different version of CNN is widely used for computer vision tasks which can build deep learning models efficiently with lesser number of shared parameters and its ability to identify different features with translational invariance.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>  On right shows the schematics of the CNN network with 4 convolutional layers followed by pooling layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Last part of the deep network is flattened and fed to a 3 layers of DNN.</li>
                    <li> Output of DNN connected to a softmax function</li>
                    <li> Valid padding and relu activation is used in all hidden layers.</li>

                </ul>
               <p> Test Results with CNN:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>The CNN model trained for 10 epochs showed an immense improvement in the classification metrics over the two MLP models, as expected with image data.</li> 
                <li> The misclassification of
                     hand and chest images were reduced significantly with the CNN model. Only 3 images were misclassifed with the CNN model.</li>
                <li>Plots below shows the classification report and confusion matrix from the CNN model.</li>

                <li>These are the three misclassified examples with the CNN. Additional similar misclassified samples are required for the model to understand such outlier images.
                    Image augmentation techniques can be used to solve this problem. However, our current CNN model is performing exeptionally well on unseen test data.

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Conclusion</h3> 
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Both MLP models successfully classified the medical images, with the CNN outperforming exceptionally well due to its architecture being more suited for image processing. This project demonstrates a comprehensive 
                approach to solving a multi-class image classification problem using deep learning techniques. </p>
